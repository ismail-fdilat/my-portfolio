# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

### Deploy your app with

$ npm run deploy

### Keep gh-pages up to date with a master branch

// Reference: http://lea.verou.me/2011/10/easily-keep-gh-pages-in-sync-with-master/

$ git add .

$ git status // to see what changes are going to be commited

$ git commit -m 'Some descriptive commit message'

$ git push origin master

$ git checkout gh-pages // go to the gh-pages branch

$ git rebase master // bring gh-pages up to date with master

$ git push origin gh-pages // commit the changes

$ git checkout master // return to the master branch

OR

Add this to the .gitconfig file =>

sync-ghpages = !git checkout gh-pages && git rebase master && git push origin gh-pages && git checkout master

then you only have to run git sync-ghpages after pushing your repo and you are goood to go .
